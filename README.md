# canapi-website
The official Canapi website (canapi.io)

This will be the informational website about what the API is, what it can do, and how easy it is to implement into your existing product. Would also include documentation ([docs.canapi.io](docs.canapi.io)) of how to integrate it into a variety of places.

Current plan is to not update main/prod for the forseeable future (as it is a placeholder site), but can build on [dev.canapi.io](dev.canapi.io) for now to get things ready when closer to time.
