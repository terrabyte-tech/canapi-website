# Terrabyte 11ty Template

The purpose of this project is to standardize the Terrabyte website development and maintenance workflow. [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a static-site generator that makes the website build process more efficient by leveraging components, site data variables, and other web dev tools. For more information on using 11ty, please read [their documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/).

Below, you will find a set of instructions for getting started with 11ty, as well as how to best utilize this template.

**NOTE:** Creating a website with 11ty requires Node.js and npm on your machine.

## Project Initialization

DigitalOcean has a great [guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-and-deploy-your-first-eleventy-website#step-2-choosing-a-templating-language) on building your first 11ty website. This guide will use their steps while adapting it to this template.

### 1. Create repo & checkout

Create a project repository in GitHub as per-norm. Initialize within GitHub by adding a README, and check it out to your local device through the GitHub CLI (or using terminal commands if you're a nerd ;).

### 2. Initialize project

Within the repo's root folder, run the following commands to create a new Node.js project...

```
npm init -y
```

...and install 11ty as a dependency.

```
npm install -D @11ty/eleventy
```

### 3. (Optional) package.json

In the created `package.json` file, replace the existing `scripts{}` object with the following `scripts{}` object:

```
...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "eleventy",
    "start": "eleventy --serve"
  },
...
```

After saving the `package.json` file, run the following command to build the project for the first time.

```
npm run build
``` 

## Project Content

Now that the 11ty project bones are in place, it's time to implement this template.

### 1. Create Subtree

By adding this template to a project folder, you are able to bring template updates into your project without disturbing your code additions later (as long as you diff right). We recommend putting the subtree in a root folder, `/template`. 

It's like a boilerplate - but if the boilerplate changes later, you can add those new pieces to projects even if they used the old boilerplate!

First, make sure all changes are committed to your branch. Then, create the subtree:

```
git subtree add --prefix=template https://github.com/terrabyte-tech/terrabyte-11ty-template.git main --squash
```

### 2. Incorporate Template

If you are starting a new project, you can simply copy all of the content from the `/template` folder into the root.

Caveats that _should not_ be copied include:

- `.git`: This is THIS project's git history - you'll make your own in your new project.
- `_site`: This is the web-ready content rendered by the 11ty build process. It will be rendered in your new project as well.
- `node_modules`: This is a folder containing node-specific files. These won't be committed in GitHub nor should they be copied from project to project (use npm for this).
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: You just changed the `package.json` file, no need to overwrite it!
- `README.md`: Your new project requires it's own README :)

### 3. Install dependencies

Before building the project again, you will need to install dependencies referenced in the template project. This includes:

#### Cheerio

Cheerio is used to create accessibility table of contents per-page (via the `.eleventy.js` file). To install the dependency, run the following command.

```
npm install cheerio
``` 

### 4. Adding project content

At this point, you should be ready to build your website as you intend. This can include building components, pages, and other files. 


#### `site.json`

This data file should be leveraged for changing site details, information, and other metadata. For a detailed set of data that can be in this file, see [/_data/site.bak.jsonc](./_data/site.bak.jsonc).

## Managing Updates

### General

Whether you are dropping in content from an old project (converting to 11ty) or starting fresh, don't forget to:

Run the build process after making changes to `.eleventy.js` or other build files.

```
npm run build
```

And run the local server in order to preview changes as you make them to site files.

```
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
``` 

### Update subtree

If you previously setup the `/template` folder subtree, you can pull the latest template into your project by running the following commands:

```
$ git update template
$ git subtree ____template repo path here____
```

#### Version History

As the template changes, so does the documented version. In order to manage what version you are on and what the latest is, template version is stored in the `package.json` file here, as well as in `site.json` for projects that leverage it. To get the most out of this template, we suggest keeping an updated subtree. For more detailed information on releases, please see the Git activity.

- v1.0: Initial release
- v1.1: Added styleType logic, fontFamily support
